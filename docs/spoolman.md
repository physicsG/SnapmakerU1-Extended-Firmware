# Spoolman Integration

Automatic filament metadata sync and spool tracking via
[Spoolman](https://github.com/Donkie/Spoolman).

## What It Provides

- Resolves a Spoolman spool by ID or RFID card UID and applies its
  metadata (vendor, material, variant, colour) to the extruder channel.
- Associates RFID card UIDs with spools automatically, so scanning a
  known card loads its filament without any manual step.
- Tracks the active spool in Moonraker so Spoolman can update remaining
  filament weight as you print.

## Enabling

Enable via Fluidd/Mainsail settings under
**Snapmaker Components > Spoolman Integration**, set the Spoolman host,
and reboot. Set the same toggle to **Disabled** to turn it off.

## Apps

Community apps that support SpoolLink, so scanning a tag resolves its spool
automatically when the filament is loaded:

**Notes:**

- **Legacy Spools** means the app converts an older tag into a SpoolLink
  link, so spools tagged before SpoolLink keep resolving:
  - **SpoolLink apps** (Android and iOS) — a scanned tag carrying an
    OpenSpool `spool_id` is linked to that spool automatically.
  - **SpoolPainter** — a scanned tag carrying an OpenSpool `spool_id`
    resolves its spool and offers to re-pair it.
  - **SpoolTagger** — migrates the whole Spoolman library in one pass on
    startup.
  - **3DMRP** — writes the current convention since v0.8.1; earlier links
    are updated on the next rescan.
  - **Spool Studio** — v3 converts tags written by its own older
    (pre-SpoolLink) spool-id format after confirmation; v2 stable remains
    available for older firmware that predates SpoolLink.
- 3DMRP's Android support is its Chrome-based mobile NFC client (Web NFC
  API); the print-farm server itself runs on Windows only.
- Apps that write filament data (material, colour, temperatures) to tags
  are listed in [RFID Format & Reader Design](design/rfid.md#apps).

## External Readers

Community hardware readers push detected tags to the same
`filament_detect/set` webhook the printer's built-in readers use. For a tag
to resolve a Spoolman spool by UID, the reader must report the UID for every
detected tag — even one it can't otherwise read — the same way
[OpenRFID](design/rfid.md#enabling-openrfid) falls back to a UID-only report
when a tag can't be parsed:

| Project | Author | SpoolLink support | Source | Support the author |
|---------|--------|--------------------|--------|---------------------|
| External - wasikuss: [snapmaker-u1-remote-rfid-reader](https://github.com/wasikuss/snapmaker-u1-remote-rfid-reader) | [wasikuss](https://github.com/wasikuss) | Partial — only reports a tag when its payload validates as OpenSpool JSON; unreadable, blank, or vendor-format tags are never reported, so those spools can't be resolved by UID | [GitHub](https://github.com/wasikuss/snapmaker-u1-remote-rfid-reader) (MIT) | — |
| External - baze: [snapmaker-u1-drybox-nfc-reader](https://gitlab.com/baze/snapmaker-u1-drybox-nfc-reader) | [baze](https://gitlab.com/baze) | Full — reports the UID for every detected tag by default ("UID-only" mode); can optionally switch to a full-read mode that also sends OpenSpool metadata, but then skips tags that aren't valid OpenSpool | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/baze/snapmaker-u1-drybox-nfc-reader) (CC BY-NC 4.0) | — |

Hardware and setup details for both readers are in
[RFID Format & Reader Design](design/rfid.md#readers).

## GCode Commands

### `SET_SPOOL_ID`

Assign a Spoolman spool to an AFC lane. Reads the lane's RFID card UID,
binds it to the spool (so a later scan resolves automatically), and
applies the filament metadata to the channel:

```
SET_SPOOL_ID LANE=E0 SPOOL_ID=5
```

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `LANE` | — | AFC lane name (e.g. `E0`) |
| `SPOOL_ID` | `0` | Spoolman spool ID; `0` clears the assignment |

## Known Conflicts

- **Leftover pre-SpoolLink Spoolman macros.** If Spoolman was previously
  wired up by hand (e.g. a community `spoolman_multi_tool`-style Klipper
  include with `CHANGE_SPOOL` and related macros) before switching to
  SpoolLink, that file conflicts with the integration and can leave
  Klipper failing to start with an error such as:

  ```
  [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/printer_data/config/variables.cfg'
  ```

  Rename or remove the old include (e.g. add a `.bak` suffix) before
  enabling Spoolman here. See
  [#567](https://github.com/paxx12-snapmaker-u1/SnapmakerU1-Extended-Firmware/pull/567#issuecomment-5118303479)
  for a reported case and workaround.

## Limitations

- Spoolman must be reachable from the printer over HTTP.
- Variant defaults to `Basic` for Snapmaker-branded filaments when not
  set in Spoolman; empty for all other vendors.

For the wire format, custom fields, and component flow see the
[design notes](design/spoolman.md). For AFC lane status that surfaces
`spool_id` see [AFC-Lite](afc-lite.md).
